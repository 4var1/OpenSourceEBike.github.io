# TSDZ2 Wireless Project Objectives

This project objective is to provide wireless TSDZ2 mid drive motor support for multiple displays, a mobile android app and a wireless remote control, just like the commercial ebikes do, for example, see: [Specialized Turbo Levo Ebike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F43oqj1Zlww).

We have developed [a DIY wireless board](https://github.com/OpenSourceEBike/TSDZ2_wireless/tree/master/EBike_wireless_TSDZ2) to connect to the motor, rather than using a display. The board is small, easy to build and costs only 25€.

With this wireless board alone, you can power on/off the TSDZ2 motor and increase/decrease the assist levels. If you use our mobile app, you will be able to accomplish the same actions and also change the motor configuration.

We also developed [our own DIY wireless remote](https://github.com/OpenSourceEBike/TSDZ2_wireless/tree/master/EBike_wireless_remote), that makes it possible control the motor to power on/off, increase/decrease the assist levels, and display motor battety levels. In addition, it can also connect to a GPS display like a Garmin Edge to change data pages.<br> 
This wireless remote costs only 20€ and the battery will work for about 2.5 years.
