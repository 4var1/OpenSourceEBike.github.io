You can buy STLinkV2 clones on EBay or Aliexpress for very cheap prices like 2â‚¬ (shipping included)

Whilst the cases look the same, there appear to be several different designs of boards inside with different microcontrollers. A few users have reported problems. If you buy one that has issues - you may be able to fix it by updating the firmware - see Troubleshooting below.

Some suggestions to buy STLinkV2:
* you can buy from EBay or Aliexpress and search for "STLinkV2"
* since they are really cheap, buy a few units
  * buy from different sellers and only 1 unit from each seller in case one doesn't work.

## Troubleshooting

If you have issues using your STLinkV2 clone adapter - try updating the firmware to the latest version.

You can get firmware from STMicroelectronics' [website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html). Note - if you are using a clone this is not supported by the manufacturer. **Use at your own risk.**



The update tool will show you the current firmware version of your adapter:
